# Kivoff

Backend infrastructure platform designed to support scalable services, internal APIs and system-level orchestration.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Kivoff is a backend-focused system built to simulate a real-world infrastructure layer used in modern applications.
It provides a foundation for building scalable services, handling internal communication, and managing data persistence.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical backend engineering skills beyond CRUD applications, focusing on structure, scalability and system design.
